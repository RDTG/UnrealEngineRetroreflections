Despite the folder name, this is only compatible with Early Access 1. Back when I made it I wasn't fully aware there was going to be a Unreal Engine 5 Preview 1 following the Early Access.

The new version compatible with UE5 Preview 1 will be pushed shortly along with fixes for these directory names.
